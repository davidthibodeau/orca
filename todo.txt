Small todo for next week:
  - fix names of bound variables in pretty


Big todos:

- merge back to main
- remove newsplit (or fill it with something)
- is-open in copy.kw should work
- remove the bctx in Unbox
- join metaOp and metaSub
- remove the old pattern matching code
- improve unification
- add coverage checking
- add termination checking (or think about it)
- improve pretty printing (i.e.: always print parseable code)
- add a strict mode for fully explicit boxes
- add a vscode mode
- implement the LSP (language server protocol)
- add a version with markdown comments for documentation (lightweight literate programming)
- instead of creating closures to apply syntactic substitutions it would be
  better to have a meta-operation that applies these (for both performance and
  simplicity reasons)
- pretty uses print if we set a flag
- pretty should print paresable code

Old todos:
* Add syntax for (x: A) (y: B) (z: C) -> D
* Add syntax for (x y: A)-> B
* Try the implicit parameters with unification thing
* Add the syntax for implicit pies
* change print_tel to print_pi and a proper print_tel
* negative test cases!
* Add syntax for impossible cases
* (low priority) Move emacs mode from generic mode to derived mode(and add features!)
* add a printf-like interface to debug
* Improve holes: add synthesizable holes
* Improve holes: list their types when done

** Lambdas that introduce multiple variables do so in the wrong order, this is done during preprocessing!!!
